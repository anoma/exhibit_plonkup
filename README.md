This is the example Plonkup circuit used during the live-coding portion of the ZkHack workshop on 2021.11.18 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u5VIzjom5E

## Quick start
Run the example circuit with

`cargo run`

## Other gates
This small example only uses two lookup gates and one addition gate. You can find the code for other gates under `src/constraint_system`.

## Disclaimer
This Plonkup branch used as a dependecy here is out-of-date. The syntax of the current version is a bit different, but similar enough to what you see here that this example should still be instructive.
